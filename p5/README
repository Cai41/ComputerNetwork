1.High-level approach:
We completed the basic http server and DNS server.
(1). For http server, after it receives request, it examine whether the path is cached or in the file, if
the request path is cached then it is directly returned to client; otherwise, the server would fetch data
from origin, caching it and send back to client.
(2). For DNS server, it just always return the address of one web server. After we complete the CDN mapping
function, we would add it to DNS funcitonality.

2.Performance enhancing:
Since we are only building basic http server and DNS server, there is few performance enhancing except that
http server caches all the pages. We also cache HTTP redirection.

3.Challengs:
(1).Building DNS server needs to know DNS packet format and meaning of each field in the packet. Also, since
the length of DNS Query is not fixed, it is a little bit hard to separate each question or addtional records
from packet.
(2).It is trade-off whether we cache HTTP redirection in web server and return it to client. We decide that
after receving HTTP redirection(code 301/302), we perform redirect at web server, cache the final page and
return it to client.

4.Next steps:
(1).Build CDN, add function to DNS server to return the best ip address to the client. Maybe we'll try serveral
approaches, measure their performance and choose the one that we think is the best.
(2).Optimize cache strategy, since there is limited space in server. We may use LRU algorithm to improve the
performance.
(3).deploy/run/stop scripts that automatically configure all the servers.
