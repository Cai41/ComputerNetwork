# Usage: 
    Please deploy, then run the CDN using the following command, after that you
can stopCDN
    ./[deploy|run|stop]CDN -p <port> -o <origin> -n <name> -u <username> -i <keyfile>

# High Level Approaches
1. deployCDN
Copy files to replica servers and DNS server, untar pre-cached files.

2. runCDN
Start the httpserver and dnsserver processes.

3. stopCDN
Kill all python processes started by current user and remove the data directory.

4. Caching
This is what we mainly focused on. 

Based on request statistics, caching 10MB of top ranked webpages can achieve 
~40% of hit rate on the cache. We decide to put them on disk to keep this part 
of cache persistent.

Webpages ranked after those top ranked files appears less often and we use a LRU 
cache in memory caching this part to achieve even higher hit ratio.
